### READ-12 EJS Partials
- Partials are basically just views that are designed to be used from within other views. They are particularly useful for reusing the same markup between different views, layouts, and even other partials.

- EJS Partials help us avoid repetition of the same code on several web pages. For example, you may want the same header for several web pages. EJS partials work like EJS layouts too in creating a single fix content on a web page.

- EJS (along with all the other competing template engines) allows you to generate full-blown HTML pages which certainly enables a "proper front-end". EJS is a tool for generating web pages that can include dynamic data and can share templated pieces with other web pages (such as common headers/footers).
