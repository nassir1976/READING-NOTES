 ###  Heroku Deployment.
- Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps. Heroku bypasses infrastructure headaches.

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

- Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform

                                });
- This code performs a request for some resource. When the response comes back, an anonymous function is called. It contains the argument data, which is the data received from that request.

So, Node allows you to use the so-called event loop, which works faster because of non-blocking behavior. For example, nginx uses an event loop with asynchronous I/O. That's why it's fast as hell!
