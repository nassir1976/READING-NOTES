### SQL
 ### What is SQL?
- SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.

- SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

 ### SQL databases includes
- SQLite
- MySQL
- Postgres
- Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server
 ### Relational databases
- A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

- A table (or schema) is a representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model

- To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.

- sql syntax example SELECT * FROM Customers;

- when we retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table, we can then use the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.
