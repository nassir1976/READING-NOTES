Project Ideas:- Events => family events =>

APIâ€™S  that will be used for the events model are ticket master and Event brite.

 

As a father of three beautiful kids or as a parent in general I would like to build an app 

that will find an event that is kids friendly or family oriented, event areas/location, 

price range/ticket availability, images of past events, nearby hotels, nearby restaurant 

and event availability.
